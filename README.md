**IECore** is an open-source library designed for Windows and macOS, leveraging ImGui as its user interface. It serves as the core framework for all applications under the Interactive Echoes (IE) brand, offering a plug-and-play setup with pre-configured entry points, making it simple to start developping C++ applications.
